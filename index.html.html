          <p>Hi there</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-7">
        <p><b>Name</b>: Liam Chan-Wicht <br />
          <b>Student Number: </b> s3803217 <br />
          <b>Email: </b> liamchanwicht@hotmail.com <br />
          <b>A bit about me: </b> I’m a half Chinese, half Australian born in Sydney.
          Mum and Dad decided to <i>smoosh</i> both of their surnames together so
          I (think) am the first Chan-Wicht <b>IN HISTORY</b>! I like to make logos and graphic stuff
          in my spare time for friends and clients and take long walks to the fridge at 2am.
          I also sing and play guitar - it’s a good bit of cathartic release every now and again. <br /></p>

        <p>I recently spent a year in Québec City and I picked up a little French whilst I was there.
          I also speak some Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese and Shanghainese) due to my heritage.</p>

          <h1 id="purpose">PURPOSE</h1>

          <p>I’ve <b>always</b> been interested in IT, from sticking pencils into expensive laptops as a
            kid to learning to code games and websites as an adult. Video Gaming has always been a large
            part of my life and it wouldn’t be possible without the ever growing field of IT.
            I attended a coding bootcamp a couple years ago that covered HTML/CSS, Ruby/Ruby on Rails,
            Javascript including MEAN/MERN stacks and decided I needed a fuller education to pursue a career in
            the IT field. I’m very excited for the next 30-40 years as I believe innovations such as Artificial
            Intelligence and Quantum Computing will drastically change our way of living.<br /></p>

          <p>I decided to go through <b>OUA/RMIT</b> as it seemed to be more accessible and enjoyable for my
            lifestyle. I had heard of OUA through a co-worker/friend of mine that studied with OUA/RMIT a few
            years back. She seemed to enjoy the experience and recommended it enthusiastically as it meant
            that you could pick and choose when to stress over study. So far, it’s a full schedule for me as
            I have a full study load with Intro to Programming, Intro to Computer Systems and lastly Intro to IT.<br /></p>

          <p>I expect to be trained to become a junior, work ready IT professional. This includes programming,
            learning how to deal with computer networks and systems, and learning to work in a team of other
            IT professionals. I also expect to become aware of new technologies and methods of implementation.</p>

          <p><b>Myers–Briggs Type Indicator:</b><br />
            INFP-A / INFP-T: <i>“Mediator Personality”</i> <br /></p>

          <p><b>Online Learning Style:</b><br />
            The Dynamo<br />
            You’re experienced in managing competing priorities and have great skills you can apply to your studies. A little extra help by way of periodic reminders will boost your study efficiency.<br /></p>

          <p><b>Big Five Personality Test:</b>
            <br />Factor 1 Extroversion <b>81</b>
            <br />Factor 2 Emotional Stability <b>96</b>
            <br />Factor 3 Agreeableness <b>76</b>
            <br />Factor 4 Conscientiousness <b>62</b>
            <br />Factor 5 Intellect/Imagination <b>93</b></p>

          <p>• <b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b> <br />
            These test results only are indicators of how I interact with certain people. I wouldn’t take it as an absolute rule as there are almost always exceptions to the rule.<br />
            • <b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br />
            I don’t think they will or should influence my behaviour as I will always try to be as geniune to my true nature whether that be in group/work/home mode.<br />
            • <b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br />
            I am not too worried about tests like this - I just want to be able to freely communicate problems to my team members and hope they are able to be transparent with me as well.<br /><br /></p>

            <p>Personal Information</p>
            <s>Include your name, student number, email address, and some basic background information nationality and culture </s>
            <p>, education to date, languages spoken etc). Include at least one fact about yourself that others may find interesting, such as a hobby, a pet or your favourite sport or other pastime.</p>

            <p>Interest in IT
              You should answer the questions below as best you can. Each answer should be one paragraph in length.</p>

            <p>• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
              • Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
              • What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>

            <p>Ideal Job
              Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may require several years of experience, and hence be something that you must work towards, rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be able to
              fill
              as
              soon as you graduate.</p>

            <p>There are various ways to search for IT jobs, including websites like {seek.com.au}. You should include the following information.</p>

            <p>• The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it (in case the link expires before the assignment deadline).
              • A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
              • A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
              • A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.
              • A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway),
              but
              try
              to be as specific as you can.</p>

            <p>Project Idea
              You are to write a report of around 1000 words describing your project idea. You should describe the project itself, as well as why you think it is important or interesting, and any potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.</p>

            <p>What are you passionate about? What kind of IT innovation would you like to see? What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?</p>

            <p>You need not have full answers to any of these questions, but you are required to have some ideas about an IT project that you think will address at least one of these questions. It may not be possible to find one that answers all
              three,
              but
              it is quite likely that something you would find interesting or useful will have a similar effect on others.</p>

            <p>There are a number of possible types of projects that you may consider. Some potential ideas are below; others will be discussed in the following weeks.</p>

            <p>Developing a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d.
              Developing a smartphone app, using whatever programming language in which you have expertise, or by using tools such as MIT App Inventor.
              Finding an innovative application for new hardware developments, such as Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys, small robots or related technologies.
              Creating a FAQ and implementing it as a chatterbot, possibly involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software.
              Building an electronic artefact such as a model for Minecraft or similar games, along the lines of the United Nations Block by Block project.
              For this assignment, you need to write approximately 1,000 words about your project idea.</p>

            <p>This should not only describe what the project would be, but also why you think it is important or interesting, and what potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.</p>

            <p>Your description should include the following sections. The word counts below are recommendations only not absolutes but are a good guide.</p>

            <p>Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be.</p>

            <p>Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence, such as: “There
              service. are 1.5 billion cat owners in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an automated cat feeder. Using Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem.”</p>

            <p>Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or service</p>

            <p>Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.</p>

            <p>Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</p>

            <p>Outcome (100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</p>
