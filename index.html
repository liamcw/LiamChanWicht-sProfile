          <b>A bit about me: </b> I’m a half Chinese, half Australian born in Sydney.
          Mum and Dad decided to <i>smoosh</i> both of their surnames together so
          I (think) am the first Chan-Wicht <b>IN HISTORY</b>! I like to make logos and graphic stuff
          in my spare time for friends and clients and take long walks to the fridge at 2am.
          I also sing and play guitar - it’s a good bit of cathartic release every now and again. <br /></p>

        <p>I recently spent a year in Québec City and I picked up a little French whilst I was there.
          I also speak some Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese and Shanghainese) due to my heritage.</p>
        <div id="purpose" style="padding:30px;">
        </div>
        <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>I’ve <b>always</b> been interested in IT, from sticking pencils into expensive laptops as a
          kid to learning to code games and websites as an adult. Video Gaming has always been a large
          part of my life and it wouldn’t be possible without the ever growing field of IT.
          I attended a coding bootcamp a couple years ago that covered HTML/CSS, Ruby/Ruby on Rails,
          Javascript including MEAN/MERN stacks and decided I needed a fuller education to pursue a career in
          the IT field. I’m very excited for the next 30-40 years as I believe innovations such as Artificial
          Intelligence and Quantum Computing will drastically change our way of living.<br /></p>

        <p>I decided to go through <b>OUA/RMIT</b> as it seemed to be more accessible and enjoyable for my
          lifestyle. I had heard of OUA through a co-worker/friend of mine that studied with OUA/RMIT a few
          years back. She seemed to enjoy the experience and recommended it enthusiastically as it meant
          that you could pick and choose when to stress over study. So far, it’s a full schedule for me as
          I have a full study load with Intro to Programming, Intro to Computer Systems and lastly Intro to IT.<br /></p>

        <p>I expect to be trained to become a junior, work ready IT professional. This includes programming,
          learning how to deal with computer networks and systems, and learning to work in a team of other
          IT professionals. I also expect to become aware of new technologies and methods of implementation.</p>
        <div id="personality-profile" style="padding:30px;"></div>
        <h1>PERSONALITY PROFILE</h1>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Myers–Briggs Type Indicator:</b><br />
          INFP-A / INFP-T: <i>“Mediator Personality”</i> <br /></p>

        <p><b>Online Learning Style:</b><br />
          The Dynamo<br />
          You’re experienced in managing competing priorities and have great skills you can apply to your studies. A little extra help by way of periodic reminders will boost your study efficiency.<br /></p>

        <p><b>Big Five Personality Test:</b>
          <br />Factor 1 Extroversion <b>81</b>
          <br />Factor 2 Emotional Stability <b>96</b>
          <br />Factor 3 Agreeableness <b>76</b>
          <br />Factor 4 Conscientiousness <b>62</b>
          <br />Factor 5 Intellect/Imagination <b>93</b></p>

        <p>These tests give me a greater insight to how I behave and I believe they are quite on the mark.
          This means I will be able to apply myself in a way that revolves around these results to get greater
          results in my personal, academic and professional life. I strongly believe I am the Mediator as shown
          in the Myers-Briggs test - I believe I act as the equaliser and glue in most of my social groups.
          Introversion is more suited to me than Extroversion, I would prefer to stay inside and read or watch a movie
          than to go to big party. That being said, I believe I am more of an ambivert, with balanced features of both
          catagories as evident by the Big Five test scoring me with a relatively high Extroversion Factor. <br />
          <br />
          Much like my social groups, I believe I will act as the glue to keep people working together,
          organising and mediating between people and potential issues. I can be very diplomatic in situations
          that call for an objective perspective. I believe this is the best way to communicate amongst friends,
          collegues and fellow students; clearly and without pretext. I won't be always adhering to the mediator role
          as I believe it is a (large) part of my personality but not to be confused with me as a whole. I can and have
          been in leadership roles in the past with great success.<br />
          <br />
          I believe that just like with everything else, you should take these tests with a grain of salt. I'm sure that there
          are aspects that resonate with you and others but I am always weary applying blanket terms and labels on individuals.
          Maybe that itself falls into the Mediator personality, but I believe when forming a team, you should look at the
          values and overall output of the person (projects, the way they present themselves, etc.) before diving deep into
          personality tests. That being said, if we were to be considering only these tests, I would find people who are more
          like me with potentially a stronger leader type. I believe this would be the ideal composition.</p>

        <h1>IDEAL JOB</h1>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=b7b408261c88aef3&q=Front+End+Web+Designer&tk=1dd1i54p880nb802&from=web&vjs=3">This</a> job posting is for a Senior UX/UI (User Interface) Front End Web Developer/Designer. A Front End Web
          Dev/Designer combines code
          and design principles to create beautiful and effective websites. These websites are the first points of contact for
          customers and greatly influence first impressions. Front End Devs/Designers utilise HTML/CSS and Javascript libraries
          such as React or Angular to create UX/UI for the client.<br />
          <br />
          This particular position calls for a minimum of 5 years of professional experience, 'proven' knowledge in SCSS, LESS & JS
          (CSS style sheet languages with different syntax & Javascript), good knowledge of CSS Animations, Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables
          & SVH manipulations, wireframing, prototyping and UX knowledge.<br />
          <br />
          I currently have a beginner/moderate level of HTML/CSS with very little experience in SCSS or LESS. I have not touched any
          CSS Animation, CSS Variables or SVH manipulations. I have a small amount of knowledge in reguards to JS and its associated
          libraries as I have used them in other projects. I have in the past and continue to practice today - Wireframing, prototyping,
          use of flexbox, and grid in web design.<br />
          <br />
          To be able to apply for this job, I must be able to build a portfolio of Web Design including all of these languages and methods of
          implementation. To start, I can look into the CSS Style Sheets SCSS and LESS. I would also need to learn or brush up on how these
          languages interact with the backend as I believe a good Front End Dev/Designer understands the application from the head down,
          even if they wouldn't be coding the backend.<br />
          <br />
          I can also apply for a UX/UI class on another web based learning platform such as Skillshare or StackSkills to understand the Design
          aspect of User Interface. After these steps, I would then need to undertake a junior role in a company where I learn how to work
          with a team and how to be able to meet deadlines etc. After a minimum of 5 years in this role, if I don't climb my way up to become
          a mid level designer, I would then be looking to jump ships to another agency for better pay/benefits. <br />
          <br />
          With a little bit of luck and hard work, I'll be able to make those 6 figures in no time flat!

        <h1>PROJECT </h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Smart Mirror</h2><br />
        <p> I've recently been fascinated with the home becoming more and more tech-infused with the Internet of Things (IoT).<br /><br />
          The only problem for me and many others is that it is difficult to set up a smart home that is suited for renters.
          As a renter, you are generally unable to affix anything to walls, install thermostats, or do anything else to compromise the integrity of the building you live in.
          This project is not as ambitious as creating life-saving robots or programs that can change whole neighbourhoods but it is one that is interesting to me.
          <br /><br />
          Every morning when I get ready, I jump out of the shower and look in the boring old mirror, thinking about what needs to be done for the day.
          If I spend too much time grooming and pondering, the time goes by and I have the potential to be late!<br /><br /> I hear what you're saying - "Just check your phone!".<br /><br />
          Well right out of the shower, I don't want to be checking my phone as my hands are wet and most of the time they have that <i>gross</i> pruny texture that doesn't let me activate my fingerprint sensor.
          What if all my information was right there, where I was already looking, ready and waiting for me? <br /><br />The time! A list of updateable daily objectives/meetings/tasks! The weather! What if I
          could speak to my mirror like a personal assistant? What if it was motion activated? How futuristic would that be? <br /><br />Pretty damn futuristic if you ask me.<br /><br />

          With the time displayed on the mirror, tracking how long it is taking to get ready will be breeze! Shorts or pants? Showing the weather will help in deciding how to dress for the day at a glance.
          A calendar or a list of daily objectives will help prepare for the day to come - an invaluable time saving tool!
          If these features are voice/ motion controlled, it will make navigation much easier as there won't be another interface to interact with to make it work.
          <br /><br />
          There are (as of 2017) <b>24.6 million</b> people living in Australia <i>ALONE</i> who more than likely, own some sort of shiny surface that isn't living up to its full potential! So how do we go about 'smartening'
          our mirrors to display all of this wonderful information? <br /><br />Two words. <i>Raspberry Pi</i>.</p>


        <br /><br />
        <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3><br />
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0">"The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
            It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.
            It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.
            <br /><br />
            What’s more, the Raspberry Pi has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects,
            from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. "</p>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer">from What is a Raspberry Pi?<cite title="Source Title"> https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/ </cite></footer>
        </blockquote>

        <br />
        A compact computer that is easily programmable and hidden behind a
        mirror! The Raspberry Pi is the perfect tool to achieve this goal. More specifically, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, as it has easy accessibility and an easy to set up wireless option.  Another option would be to use Arduino, a simpler platform by all definitions.
        I believe the Raspberry Pi would be the better choice as it runs Linux and is much more sophisticated (more RAM, more ports, and a whole operating system!). A USB mouse and keyboard will also be needed to interact with the Pi.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Monitor</h3><br />

        So we have what will process all of our lovely ideas but how will we display it? A computer monitor. Plugging in the Raspberry Pi to even a second-hand computer monitor will allow us to have a Graphic User Interface (GUI) to play around with.
        As the
        Pi has a HDMI out port, we will need a monitor that at least has a HDMI In. Speaking of HDMI ports, quite obviously we will need a HDMI cable so add that to the shopping list. We will also need a Micro HDMI Cable for the Pi Power Supply. An
        added advantage of this project is the potential 'upcycling' of an old monitor that is just laying about. If there isn't one handy, cheap monitors are a dime a dozen nowadays. <br /><br />

        <h3>Mirror</h3><br />
        Now unfortunately not all mirrors will be the most optimal choice for this project. One way mirrors will work best for this project as they allow the glass to be semi-transparent to be able to 'shine through' and display 'on' the mirror. Think of all
        those interrogation scenes on TV. When one room is lit, it behaves like a mirror. Otherwise, it's just a normal window. Ideally, the mirror will be the same size if not a little larger than the monitor. There is the possibility of having a
        smaller 'smart area' with larger mirror space by adjusting the ratios of monitor to mirror.<br /><br />

        <h3>Software</h3><br />
        <p>This is where you discover that this fantastic idea has been around for about 4 years already. The upside of this, is that you can just use the open source software, <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror">MagicMirror²</a>. The downside is that you won't be internationally famous for thinking you came up with a cool idea.
          <blockquote class="blockquote"> MagicMirror² is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the MagicMirror² allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant.
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">from MagicMirror² GitHub Repo<cite title="Source Title"> https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror</cite></footer>
          </blockquote>
          <p> This repo contains a complete tutorial covering installation and customisation. Nice. No need to code from scratch! This cuts a lot of hours out of the project that can be used in other endeavors. Not only that, but when you are comfortable enough with the code, you can contribute to it through GitHub's collaborative systems.</p>
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3><br />
        <p>This project can be completed within a single weekend and I believe it is a very feasible option to add another smart device to your collection! The ease of access to all components really help make this project accessible to those of all skill levels. The level of documentation of not only the MagicMirror² platform but the Raspberry Pi will make the process even easier for people who have zero experience but still want to undertake the project. <br /> <br />I believe this project will not only solve the problem of a lack of 'at glance updates' but also serve as a good introductory activity for those interested in the Raspberry Pi and its capabilities. Personally, I will be attempting this project in the near future as it will teach me how to interact with hardware components and its interaction with software. Plus, i'll get a cool future mirror out of it.</p><br />
